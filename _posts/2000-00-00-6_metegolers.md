# **Metegolers**
## Mobile Multiplayer Game

This project means a great step forward in terms of technical requirements, integrating mobile development, multiplayer components and server side operations.

Metegolers uses [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/) for client-server interactions, delivering an engaging player-vs-player physics based foosball experience. Players can create their own accounts and jump straight into matches, with a robust REST API and separate database enabling precise matchmaking and tournament management. The system tracks player points, facilitating competitive rankings and positioning.

### **Project Contributions**

- **Mirror Integration:** Enabled seamless scene and player interaction over the network using the Mirror framework.  
- **Smooth Rigidbody Physics:** Implemented interpolation for realistic ball movement in the foosball game.  
- **Backend API for Matchmaking:** Designed a Python REST API for player matchmaking and tournament management.  

### **What I Learned**

This project enhanced my understanding of multiplayer game development, particularly in implementing real-time interactions with Mirror. I gained valuable experience in creating smooth physics systems for gameplay mechanics and designing backend solutions for matchmaking. Additionally, I developed skills in integrating secure authentication systems and managing server-client communication effectively.
