# **Diaguitas**
## Single Player Game

The first-ever serious team project I was involved in. Even though it was never published, our team put in its best effort to develop an experience that could be playable and fun.

## **Project Contributions**

- **Animation Blending Tree:** Designed a seamless animation system for fluid character movements.
- **Auto-Focus System:** Created a dynamic mechanic that tracks enemies and adjusts focus during combat.
- **Combat Hitbox System:** Implemented hitbox mechanics inspired by 2D fighting games for responsive and engaging combat.

## **What I Learned**

This project taught me the value of teamwork and using Git. I improved my ability to communicate technical ideas, manage priorities, and deliver functional systems. It also solidified my passion for game development and my commitment to mastering this craft.
