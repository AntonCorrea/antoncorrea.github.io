### **What I Learned**

By synchronizing player scores with an external database for a real-time public scoreboard, implementing cross-platform input systems such as touchscreen and joystick support, and implementing a user-friendly UI for login and score tracking cemented my skill to deliver quick builds and quick fixes, as the requirements keep changing until the day of presentation.
